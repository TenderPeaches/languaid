# README

A local web-app that helps the user build up a vocabulary when learning new languages. Sort of on hold because I made it as I was learning Rails and I haven't bothered to go over and update it to something a bit more decent.

Words can be added to the dictionary alongside their common translations, linked by a common definition. The definition is optional, as the primary goal is to help quickly navigate from one language to another rather than to build an actual dictionary. Words can be grouped and consulted under category tags.

Exercises are next.
